<h1> Introduction To Python and Object-Oriented Programing</h1>
<h2>
    <p style="color: aliceblue">
        In the recent years, the boom in tech sectors, have grasped the world. The constant advancement in technologies,
        have also caused an urgency to create new languages that are more programmer friendly. The two most popular
        programing languages are python and Java, both of these are object-oriented languages.Object-oriented programing
        languages, are based on the idea that objects contain data and code. These objects are usually based on classes
        and are linked to methods, which are functions of what they would do. In this section we will discuss, python,
        as an object-oriented language and go over the basic terminologies that are related python.
    </p>
    <p style="color: aliceblue">
    Python, has gained a lot of popularity in the recent years. In most sectors of technology, python is often used.
    This is because python is a programing language that is relatively accisble to the user, and has instructions that
    closely resemble normal language syntax like english, so it's extremely user freindly, compared to other programming
    languages. Python is an amazing programing language for a few things:
<ul style="color: aliceblue">
    <li> Creating a more compact code, allowing users to follow the coding. Its is actually a great way to learn coding. </li>
    <li>It is amazingly simple and the syntax is easy to follow and read. The layout is straightforward that allows you
    to do that.</li>
    <li>It is versatile, meaning that it can be used for data visualization, AI, or even web and app development. </li>
</ul>
