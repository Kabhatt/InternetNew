        <p>Silicon Valley, the tech hub area, a name that now is associated with sky rocketing real estate prices where the top 1% of society's
            elites have a hard time keeping up with the rising prices. It's where big companies like Google, Amazon, Apple and many other tech
            companies have their head quaters at, or where many found their origins in. It's where the story and expiriences of an
            an entire generation are complied, where the changes of an old world to a new world started. But how and
            why is this place so important in terms of technology? Well the entire boom of the silicon valley market started with the boom of the internet.
            When the internet became available to the general public, many tech start ups or internet based compaies were located in this area due
            to it's proximity to the computer systems and the universities that used them. In this section we will discuss the timeline of the many
            entrepreneurs as well as the technologies that affected the growth of Silicon Valley.

           <p> Silicon Valley was first founded by Jim Clark, who made the offer to invest in Mark Andersen's modified version of internet which was extremely user friendly.
           </p> In 1993 Mark Andreesen, made a browser which turned the internet in to a user friendly and allowed for an internet rich world. This allowed the web growth of 341,000% and that same
            year he posted Mosaic online for the public to download. They initially sent the material to download to 12 people and that eventually became 100, 200, 300, 1000 etc. This was iconic because the year
            after the very first blog ever created was made by  Justin Hall in 1994. While the internet became more user friendly, Bill Gates, in 1994, gates created Microsoft network, in which Microsoft would manage
            the internet network and people would have to pay Microsoft to use. In that same year Netscape communications and it's browser the navigator was launched, it was the fastest running communication company
