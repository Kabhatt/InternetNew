        <h1> The Internet...Where Did It All Began? </h1>
        <div id="pic1">
        <p> One would believe that the discovery of the internet and the way we see computers as they are today are due to recent discoveries,
            however the actual development to modern internet technology started in the late 1800s with Ida Lovelace starting the first programing
            language, also known as coding, which was first created in the 1840s. How-ever the actual discovery for modern internet technology started with John
            Tyndal who demonstrated that the light uses internal reflection, through jet of water. This would eventually be an important discovery for fiber optics
            used to carry information for the world of computers and internet.This technology would lated be used by Narinder Singh Kapany in 1952, who creatd the first fiber cable based on John Tyndall’s experiments.
            These cables, are laid across the world's ocean floors and help the world communicate with each other.

            The real process and the accelerated process of creating the internt started in the last century, during the Cold-War. The then US president, President Eisenhower, understood the
            great need of attaining a better and more efficient communication method across the country, after seeing the devastation Nuclear bombs in Japan caused. It is important to remember that back in the cold war era,
            the world's communication system worked on thses call centers relied on phone operators to make the connections between telephone lines manually. This was a huge issue of national concern because if USSR droped a nuclear bomb or a war emerged and one of these telephone
            service centers were affected that would have caused a complete abrution and delay in communicating important messages for National security, this concern was amplified with the launch of Sputnick in 1958. So in a move to build a better National Secrutity system, in 1958, the US government forms ARPA (eventually became DARPA) or the Advanced Research Projects Agency.
            ARPA used to focus on space and technology, but Nasa eventually was created in 1962 and thus space became NASA’s jurisdiction and United Stated started to focus on space travel.•	It wasn't until 1962, when an MIT psychologist by the name of J.C.R Liklieder, came up with a basic idea of the internet by theorizing a way to connect networks for computers that accelerated the process further.
            This gave the developers a structure of what the internet should be like. The in 1962 Leonard Kleinrock wrote a thesis in Queuing Theory, in which, a message would arrive and hang around for a while and leave. Then in 1963 ASCII are developed, these were the American standard code for information exchange. This became the bases of what information exchange would need to meet the requirement of
            getting messages through.Things were still set in th early phases of getting the machinery that we call the internet started. It wasn't until •	Paul Barran came up with hot potato routing, where the data of the phone calls would be chopped up to smaller pieces and they would travel towards nodes and they would be recorded and kept safe, even if some area of the network was destroyed these
            nodes would still have back up of that same data. This method was inspired by a mouse in a maze study. This was a revolutionary idea in data communications. Barran used the idea from telegram to chop up the messages in to packages and around this time Bob Taylor asked ARPA for funding to find a way to connect heterogenous computers through a network. He was granted $1 million for his idea and research. •	By the end of 1969 all the 4 mainframe computers in
            various locations in California were interconnected all by ARPANet. Larry Roberts was recruited by Bob Taylor, who already built the first network at MIT Lincoln laboratories between two computers. Then in 1965 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore discovered the Moore’s law, in which he states that the number of transistors that fit in to chip doubles once every two years. Allowing for computers to become smaller in size. This was an important feature for silicon valley’s entrepreneurs in the 90s.

      <p>  While the smaller sizes of computers were preparing to give rise to many future billionaires and millionaires of Silicone Valley, Larry Roberts was recruiting engineers to build the ARPANet which would eventually become the internet, in 1968. This It was based on interface message processors or IMPs, and based on packet switching.  This experiment was done on 4 different mainframe computers, all located in various Californian universities, but done with IMPs.
        In 1969, BBN took the project of packet switching communication systems, and started to build the IMPs for the ARPAnet. Dr. Stephen Crocker, a graduate student, wrote the code for the first IMPs for ARPAnet and in 1969 the first piece of hardware created for the first piece of the forerunner of the internet arrived to UCLA. U wasn't until 1970s when things became more mainstream in terms of communication for the world. In 1971, Raymond Tomlinson, a programmer on the ARPANET system created email, and initiated
        the "@" symbol. In 1972, ARPA demonstrates the computer network in Washington D.C, and less than 25 sites on line with more to come and  first international meeting on computers and ARPA happened. Then 1973 Bob Kahn, and Vint Cerf, teamed up to develop a set of rules TCP/IP protocol, which would allow different computers to pass their packets back and forth. IPV4 is designed.

            Now you must know the famus Bill Gates, well in 1975 bill gates dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with his partner Paul Allen, this would be a very important event for both the internet and the Silicone Valley later on. In 1980 Robert Metcalfe, founder of the Ethernet, came up with the theory that the value of the communication networks was proportional to the number of it’s users squared. This eventually became Metcalf’s law, and influenced silicon valley’s production in the 1990s.
            In 1983 TCPIP was adopted as the universal standard of internet network. Meaning if there are 10 users there are 45 different ways of network connections.  1989 Physicist named Tim Berners lee found a way to allow threads of knowledge to be stored in the internet, which was previously hard to do. He created a software which would store information with random association, he called it world-wide web.
            Finally, history was made on June 9th 1992, US Congress passed a bill  that internet be available to citizens and not just restricted to government and in November 1993 president George H.W Bush signed it making it a law.
