        <p> One would believe that the discovery of the internet and the way we see computers as they are today are due to recent discoveries,
            however the actual development to modern internet technology started in the late 1800s with Ida Lovelace starting the first programing
            language, also known as coding, which was first created in the 1840s. How-ever the actual discovery for modern internet technology started with John
            Tyndal who demonstrated that the light uses internal reflection, through jet of water. This would eventually be an important discovery for fiber optics
            used to carry information for the world of computers and internet.This technology would lated be used by Narinder Singh Kapany in 1952, who creatd the first fiber cable based on John Tyndallâ€™s experiments.
            These cables, are laid across the world's ocean floors and help the world communicate with each other.
