        <h1> The Internet...Where Did It All Began? </h1>
        <p> One would believe that the discovery of the internet and the way we see computers as they are today are due to recent discoveries,
            however the actual development to modern internet technology started in the late 1800s with Ida Lovelace starting the first programing
            language, also known as coding, which was first created in the 1840s. How-ever the actual discovery for modern internet technology started with John
            Tyndal who demonstrated that the light uses internal reflection, through jet of water. This would eventually be an important discovery for fiber optics
            used to carry information for the world of computers and internet.This technology would lated be used by Narinder Singh Kapany in 1952, who creatd the first fiber cable based on John Tyndall’s experiments.
            These cables, are laid across the world's ocean floors and help the world communicate with each other.

            The real process and the accelerated process of creating the internt started in the last century, during the Cold-War. The then US president, President Eisenhower, understood the
            great need of attaining a better and more efficient communication method across the country, after seeing the devastation Nuclear bombs in Japan caused. It is important to remember that back in the cold war era,
            the world's communication system worked on thses call centers relied on phone operators to make the connections between telephone lines manually. This was a huge issue of national concern because if USSR droped a nuclear bomb or a war emerged and one of these telephone
            service centers were affected that would have caused a complete abrution and delay in communicating important messages for National security, this corncer was amplified with the launch of Sputnick in 1958. So in a move to build a better National Secrutity system, in 1958, the US government forms ARPA (eventually became DARPA) or the Advanced Research Projects Agency.
            ARPA used to focus on space and technology, but Nasa eventually was created in 1962 and thus space became NASA’s jurisdiction and United Stated started to focus on space travel.•	It wasn't until 1962, when an MIT psychologist by the name of J.C.R Liklieder, came up with a basic idea of the internet by theorizing a way to connect networks for computers that accelerated the process further.
            This gave the developers an structure of what the internet should be like. The in 1962 Leonard Kleinrock wrote a thesis in Queuing Theory, in which, a message would arrive and hang around for a while and leave. Then in 1963 ASCII are developed, these were the American standard code for information exchange.
