    <h1>Understanding SOLID</h1>
    <p> Many object-oriented languages overlap in many things, from usage of certain structures for the codes or using similar
    libraries. In the same sense, most object-oriented programing relied on a set of principles that are important in creating software. One such principle is called SOLID.
    Solid is an acronym and it stands for:

        <li> <span style="color: coral"; style="font-style: oblique"> L </span>: Liskov Substitution Principle </li>

        <li> <span style="color: coral"; style="font-style: oblique"> I </span>: Interface Segregation Principle </li>

        <li> <span style="color: coral"; style="font-style: oblique"> D </span>: Dependency Inversion Principle </li>
    <P> Now that we know what the abbreviations lets talk about what each term means.</P>
<h2>Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle means that every module, class and function needs to be functional for a single part of the program's functionality. This means that
classes, modules, or functions mist have only one job. So for example in our calculator we have multiple classes, like division. subtraction, addition, or multiplication; but each of these classes
have one single function. No function overlaps another function. </p>

    <p> Often times we see programs where a piece of code that does multiple things like it loads data, modifies it, plots them,
    and then returns the result. So a great way to write the code is to split the functions in to smaller or atomic functions. Like our calculator class. With this method, we only need one reason to change each function that is connected with the calculator class.</p>

<p> This type of format allows the coder a lot of ease in localizing error. Meaning that if there is any issues with one section of our code
then we can locate the code's error using the smaller sections of our code. This accelerates the process of debugging our program and also makes it an efficient process. This is also a way for us to reuse our code in another section of the program which we see when we do tests with multiple classes, be it calculator class, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division classes.
 Finally, this also allows the coder to write efficient and detailed codes with some ease.</p>
    <h3>Open-Closed Principle</h3>
<p> Open-Closed Principle is the idea that the codes that are already written should not be modified because new functions are added in. This in no way means that we cannot or should not change our codes when we make mistakes or need to modify them, but
if the sole cause of modification is based on us adding new functions then it is not needed or required. One of the best things about our calculator was the fact that when we added new functions old codes were not needed to be changed. For example, our simple calculator with the calculator test lacked the division function. So instead of changing all the codes that were previousaly there, we just added a new function and modified the test class to include the new functions.</p>

    <img src="images/simplecalctest.png" height="300px" width="300px" style="display:inline;">
<p> As you can see in our above example, we did not modify any codes that were previously written, we simply added the division function and then divide by zero error, in both test and the actual calculator.</p>
